# Iterative Salience Occlusion

Code Repository to check robustness of 3D Deep Learning (Volumetric and PointNet) to occlusion attacks.
This repository reproduces the results reported in the CVPR2019 paper: 

`Robustness of 3D Deep Learning in an Adversarial Setting'

This repository also contains all of the code and data for completing the following tasks:
*   Training of PointNet and VoxNet architectures on ModelNet and KITTI
*   Evaluating trained architectures with random and saliency occlusion
*   Plotting/Displaying 3D files from the dataset + their critical sets
*   Reproducing Plots from the paper.

Things that can be requested via email:
*   Code to generate KITTI object dataset used by this paper
*   Original driving sequences used to source the KITTI dataset
